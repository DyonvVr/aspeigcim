@article{Lee2020,
   abstract = {We describe quantum circuits with only $\widetilde\{\cal O\}(N)$ Toffoli
complexity that block encode the spectra of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians in a
basis of $N$ arbitrary (e.g., molecular) orbitals. With $\{\cal O\}(\lambda /
\epsilon)$ repetitions of these circuits one can use phase estimation to sample
in the molecular eigenbasis, where $\lambda$ is the 1-norm of Hamiltonian
coefficients and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. This is the lowest
complexity that has been shown for quantum computations of chemistry within an
arbitrary basis. Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors, this matches the
scaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can only work with
orthogonal basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane
wave dual basis). Our key insight is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a
method known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to transform the Coulomb
operator into an isospectral diagonal form with a non-orthogonal basis defined
by the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the non-orthogonal THC
Hamiltonian, in a fashion that avoids most complications of the non-orthogonal
basis. We also reanalyze and reduce the cost of several of the best prior
algorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear comparison to
the present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling spacetime
volume, compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules
such as FeMoCo reveals that our method requires the least fault-tolerant
resources of any known approach. By laying out and optimizing the surface code
resources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated using
about four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, assuming
$1\,$\{\textmu\}s cycle times and physical gate error rates no worse than
$0.1\%$.},
